                Ratan Tata is an inspiration since he is a successful self-made individual. Young businessmen look up to him, and India is proud of him.
                Despite coming from a prosperous family in India, Ratan Tata did not inherit his father's vast business empire. Instead, he began from nothing and throughout the course of his career, grew a prosperous empire. With a net worth of more than $20 billion, he is currently one of the wealthiest men in India. The life of Ratan Tata serves as an example for aspiring young businesspeople. He demonstrates that great things can be accomplished with perseverance and hard work.

                Sir Ratan was a personal friend of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, the great Indian social reformer and freedom fighter. Impressed with the work of Gokhale's Servants of India Society, Sir Ratan donated an amount of Rs10,000 annually for a period of 10 years to support its welfare work for the weaker sections of the society.
                Tata Trusts under the Chairmanship of Ratan Tata provided a grant of ₹750 million to the Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science to study mechanisms underlying the cause of Alzheimer's disease and to evolve methods for its early diagnosis and treatment.
